Notes:
Was following along with the linkedin learning course; for a 2hr course it was taking a long time to wrap up. 

However, I misunderstood the w2 assignment - I thought we had to complete that course and build the website. 

On re-reading the assignment, I once more misunderstood - thought we had to do the one made from the workshop. 

I now understand that this is not the case.

So here, in an alternate branch, I submit the app I had built as part of the nodejs linkedin learning course. 

Please note that I have to approve ip addresses as to who can submit and read items from the database.
